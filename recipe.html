        <p>
            If there's a food I can eat the rest of my life it is 
            definitely going to be jollof rice.
            Jollof rice is one of the most common if not the most 
            common West Africa rice dishes which when prepared well
            is always finger-licking good and gives an award winning
            taste and satifasction.
